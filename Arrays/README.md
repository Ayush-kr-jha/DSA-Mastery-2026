# Arrays Folder

This folder contains C++ programs that demonstrate fundamental and intermediate operations on arrays and vectors.

## Files

1. **arrays_basics.cpp**
   - Linear search in an array
   - Reverse array using 2-pointer approach
   - Calculate sum and product of array elements
   - Swap maximum and minimum elements
   - Print unique elements
   - Intersection of two arrays

2. **vectors_basics.cpp**
   - Vectors in C++ STL
   - Initialization methods
   - Push, pop, clear operations
   - Access elements using `front()`, `back()`, and `at()`
   - Resize and reverse vectors
   - Single number problem (LeetCode 136)

3. **kadane_max_subarray.cpp**
   - Kadane's Algorithm
   - Finds maximum contiguous subarray sum
   - Handles arrays with negative numbers

4. **majority_element_moore.cpp**
   - Find majority element (> n/2 occurrences)
   - Three approaches:
     - Brute-force
     - Sorting
     - Moore’s Voting Algorithm

## Notes
- All programs are written in **C++**.
- Code includes **comments** explaining logic and time complexity.
